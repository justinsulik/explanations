You will be shown about 20 explanations that people gave in response to a "Why" question, such as “Why do lightbulbs glow when the electricity is turned on?” or ”Why do deer have antlers?" 

You need to rate whether each explanation includes information about mechanism. Mechanism here just means it explains HOW something happens. 

The following explanation of lightbulbs mentions mechanism: "The flow of electrons heats the wire, and hot things glow.” Even though it's not perfect, it still addresses the question HOW, because it equates to saying “BY HEATING the wire, the flow of electrons causes it to glow”.  A simple test of whether the explanation mentions mechanism is that you could rephrase it in this way, using “BY + ___ING”. 

In answering "Why do deer have antlers?", a possible explanation is "Antlers help them fight, and the winners get to breed". This gives some information about mechanism because you could rephrase it as "Antlers increase their chances of breeding BY HELPING them win fights”. So this addresses HOW having antlers leads to breeding. 

Another possible explanation is "Because they need antlers in the mating season". However, this doesn't say HOW needing them in the mating season leads to deer having antlers, so there's NO mention of mechanism here. If the explanation is just “Because of evolution” then there is no mention of a specific mechanism either, because it doesn’t address HOW evolution leads to antlers in this case. 

You should ignore whether the explanation is true or good or complete. It can be false or poor or incomplete, and still contain information about mechanism.
