You will be shown about 20 explanations that people gave in response to a "Why" question, such as "Why do lightbulbs glow when the electricity is turned on?" or "Why do deer have antlers?"

You need to rate how **general** each explanation is. For instance, the fact that it is October 24 2017 is only true on the day that I am typing this. The fact that $1+1=2$ is always true, universally. 

The following will give you some guidance and further examples for each rating. 

| | Rating | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| 1 | Rarely true | One-off event | Today is October 24 2017 |
| 2 | Infrequently true | Might happen more than once, but still very uncommon | Some people are geniuses |
| 3 | Occasionally true | More often false than true | Some people are doctors |
| 4 | Sometimes true | True about half the time | Some people are women |
| 5 | Often true | More often true than false | Most people are right handed |
| 6 | Usually true | Almost always true, but there may be a couple of exceptions | People have 2 eyes |
| 7 | Always true | True at all times and in all places | Triangles have 3 sides |

Please note, you are responding to **generality**, not the amount of information given in the explanation or how good the explanation is. Imagine the question is "Why do deer have antlers?" and the explanation is just “Evolution.” This is very low on information (it’s just one word) and it seems like a poor explanation (it seems very vague). However, your rating should be "6 - Usually true" because evolution is the general explanation for why animals look the way they do.
