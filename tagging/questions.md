Use these tagging instructions to help you classify the questions according to what kind of information you think they're asking about

Please remember that each question could be asking about several different kinds of information, so you can tag it with multiple domains. 

## Physical

This includes any physical interactions or properties, such as physical energy, force, blind causation, collision, non-biological movement, mass, and other physical dimensions. For example, if someone trips and falls, then the trajectory of their fall depends on things like their mass, the speed they were going, gravity, and the position or shape of the obstacle. If my hand doesn't fit into a glove, it's because of the relative sizes of the hand and glove.

## Chemical

This is straightforwardly a matter of chemicals and chemical interactions. Some of these might *also* be physical (e.g. gunpowder causing an explosion) and some might be *also* be biological (e.g. digestion involving an acid).

## Biological

This depends on on living beings. Related ideas include the constituents of living beings (e.g. cells, body parts), the drives of living beings (e.g. survival, mating, nutrition), or typical processes of living beings (e.g. birth, growth, death). 

## Neuroscience

This involves brains, the nervous system, neurons, or signals between neurons.

## Psychological

This is a matter of the human mind, and includes what people believe, think and do, or their aptitudes, habits, senses or cognitive dysfunctions. 

## Other social sciences

These questions are about *groups* of humans. Examples include human society, tradition, history, culture, politics, economics, etc.
